# Pearson Curve - Types
### Aim: 
To fit a known probability distribution to a particular dataset based on **Pearson’s Distributions**. The sample data can be in different forms, for example, they can be a series of isolated points (single data points) or binned data represented by upper and lower bounds.
<br />
A conventional way to solve the problem of data fitting is by the *least square approximation* method. But here, we will use Pearson’s method and apply the theory, which uses a general *differential equation* to represent different types of distributions. We use *method of moments* to know about the about the inferences we can make using the sample data and classify the observed data into certain *types* which would in turn tell us the curve which would be a reasonably good fit for the above mentioned dataset.
